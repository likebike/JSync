# JSync
Practical JSON Delta Operations and Streaming

I created this many years ago, before [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) existed.  It is an independent discovery and implementation of the same patterns, solving the same problems.  (In my opinion, JSync is an even simpler and better solution.)  Most people should use Redux instead, due to its mainstream adoption.

One of the main advantages of JSync is that it was designed to be compatible with legacy browsers, going back to IE6 (without transpilation or polyfills).  Modern, mainstream libraries don't do this.
