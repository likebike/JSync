# JSync
Practical JSON Delta Operations and Streaming

I created this many years ago, before [Flux](https://facebook.github.io/flux/) and [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) existed.  It is an independent discovery and implementation of the same patterns, solving the same problems.  (In my opinion, JSync is an even simpler and better solution.)  Most people should use Flux and Redux instead, due to their mainstream adoption.
